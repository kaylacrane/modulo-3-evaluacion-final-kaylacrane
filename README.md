# Module 3: Final Project

The object is to create a webpage that lets the user display and filter characters from the TV series *Rick and Morty*. 

### Requirements
- Use React ⚛️ 
- Have at least one component for each of the following:
  - Filters with a minimum of search by name (text input)
  - CharacterList which displays a CharacterCard for each character
  - CharacterCard showing character's name, photo, and species
  - CharacterDetail showing character's foto, name, species, origin, number of episodes, and living/dead status
- Use React Router to build navigation between components

### Extra Credit
- Error components for no results or character not found circumstances
- Use icons/emojis to display character data
- Order characters alphabetically
- Good responsive design, especially for small devices
- Use a grid system to display characters
- CSS: Make it pretty 💄💋
